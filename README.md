# BT-7274

Bravo-Tango-Seven-Two-Seven-Four, often simply referred to as BT-7274 or BT, is a veteran Vanguard-class Titan of the Frontier Militia's Special Recon Squadron (SRS), piloted by Captain Tai Lastimosa up until his demise at the outset of the Battle of Typhon, as part of Operation: Broadsword. Upon Lastimosa's death and under extreme circumstances, BT linked to then-Rifleman Jack Cooper, and the duo fought their way across Typhon to complete Special Operation 217 and stop the IMC from using its newfound weapon of mass destruction, the Fold Weapon, to devastate the Militia. The Titan ultimately sacrificed himself to destroy the Fold Weapon while protecting Cooper, securing the Militia's decisive victory in the battle. Despite his destruction, it is possible that his AI somehow still survives.

For all intents and purposes, BT-7274 is the deuteragonist of Titanfall 2's single-player campaign, serving as Jack Cooper's right hand and protector.
